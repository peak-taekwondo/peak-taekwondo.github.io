Our goal is to support our family as it grows, not only in Taekwondo, but in life. When we step into the dojang, wherever that physically may be, we are entering a safe space where all are welcome, appreciated, and nurtured.<h3>Meet the instructors</h3><div class="instructors"><div class="card instructor"><div class="bio-header"><img src="resources/bert_downing.jpg"><div class="name-and-ranks"><h3 class="name">Master Bert Downing</h3><div class="ranks"><ul><li>4th Dan in World Taekwondo (Kukiwan)</ul></div></div></div><div class="bio"><p>"I received my first black belt in Tang Soo Do in 1988 from <a href="http://ksatkd.net">Karate Sports Academy</a> under the instruction of Grand Master Ron Jenkins.
